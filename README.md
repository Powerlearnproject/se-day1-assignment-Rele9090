#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software in a structured and systematic way. It ensures that software is reliable, efficient, and scalable.
Quality & Reliability – Well-engineered software is less prone to errors and failures.
Efficiency – It helps in optimizing resources and performance.
Scalability – Software needs to grow with business and user demands.
Security – Protecting user data and system integrity is crucial.
Collaboration – Teams need structured approaches to work efficiently
------‐

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

a) The beginning of Software Engineering was in 1968 – When the term was first introduced at a conference held in Garmisch, Germany by NATO to address the "software crisis" where software was becoming complex, costly and hard to manage. The discussions at the conference laid the foundation for software engineering as a structured discipline, emphasizing principles like modular programming, structured design, and software development methodologies.
b) Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s) – Languages like Java and C++ made software development more modular and reusable. The rise of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in software, such as Windows and Mac OS, was heavily influenced by OOP.
Enterprise software like database management systems (e.g., Oracle, MySQL) and web development frameworks began incorporating OOP principles.
c) Agile and DevOps (2000s-Present) – As software projects grew bigger and more complex, traditional development methods like the Waterfall model (where each phase is completed before moving to the next) started to feel too slow and rigid. Companies needed a way to deliver software faster, adapt to changes, and improve teamwork—this is where Agile and DevOps came in.
Agile methodologies improved flexibility in development, while DevOps bridged the gap between development and operations for faster deployment.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.. The main phases include:

1. Planning – Understanding project requirements and defining goals.
2. Analysis – Gathering user needs and documenting system requirements.
3. Design – Creating blueprints for software structure and user interfaces.
4. Implementation (Coding) – Writing the actual code.
5. Testing – Ensuring the software is bug-free and works as expected.
6. Deployment – Releasing the software to users.
7. Maintenance – Fixing issues and making updates over time.
--------

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile are two different approaches to software development, each with its own strengths and best-use scenarios.

1. Waterfall Methodology: A Step-by-Step Approach : The Waterfall model follows a linear and sequential process, meaning each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. It works well for projects with clear requirements that are unlikely to change.

Phases of Waterfall:
1. Requirement Gathering – Define everything clearly before starting.
2. Design – Plan the software structure and architecture thoroughly.
4. Implementation (Coding) – Write the actual code.
5. Testing – Check for bugs and ensure it meets requirements.
6. Deployment – Release the final product.
7. Maintenance – Fix issues and update the software over time.

Recommended for:
Projects with fixed requirements (e.g., government, healthcare, banking systems).
Large-scale enterprise software with minimal expected changes.
Example: Building a medical records system where regulations require every feature to be planned and approved before development begins.

Pros:
✔ Clear structure and well-documented process.
✔ Easy to manage for large teams.
✔ Works well when requirements are stable.
Cons:
✖ Hard to adapt if requirements change.
✖ Users don’t see the product until the end, leading to surprises.
✖ Bugs found late in the process can be costly to fix.
--------------

2. Agile Methodology: A Flexible, Iterative is an adaptive and collaborative approach where development happens in small cycles called sprints (typically 1-4 weeks). Instead of waiting until the end, teams release working software frequently and adjust based on feedback.

Key Agile Practices:
Scrum Framework: Organizes work into sprints with daily stand-up meetings.
Kanban Boards: Visualize work in progress (Trello, Jira).
Frequent Releases: Continuous improvements instead of one big launch.
User Feedback: Involves customers early and often.

Recommended For:
Projects with changing requirements (e.g., startups, mobile apps, web platforms).
Teams that need fast feedback and continuous improvements like financial departments.
Example: Developing a financial management app where new features (like tracking of money or payment options) can be added and improved based on user feedback.

Pros:
✔ More flexible and adaptable to changes.
✔ Delivers value to users quickly.
✔ Encourages teamwork and continuous feedback.
Cons:
✖ Requires active team involvement and frequent communication.
✖ Can be challenging to manage for very large, rigid projects.
✖ Continuous changes may lead to scope creep (project expanding beyond original plans).

 Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer – Writes and maintains code, develops features, fixes bugs.
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Tests software to find and fix issues before release.
3. Project Manager – Plans, coordinates, and ensures the project stays on track and meets deadlines

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) help developers write, test, and debug code efficiently in one place.
Examples: Visual Studio Code> Version Control Systems (VCS) track code changes, making collaboration easy.
like: Git used with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

Why are they important?
IDEs improve coding speed and reduce errors.
VCS ensures developers can collaborate without overwriting each other's work.
---

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

a) Fixing Errors in Code. The Problem: Code doesn’t work, and you don’t know why.
How to Fix It:
Read error messages carefully—they often tell you what’s wrong.
Use print statements or debugging tools to track what’s happening.
Google the error, for better explanation 

b) Keeping Up with New Technologies.The Problem: Technology changes rapidly, and it’s hard to keep up at times 
How to Fix It:
Follow tech blogs, and news for updates.
Focus on learning one thing at a time instead of everything at once.
Join Tech communities to stay updated.

c) Understanding Complex Code. The Problem: Other people’s or even your own code can be confusing sometimes.
How to Fix It:
Break it into smaller parts and understand one step at a time.
Add comments to explain tricky parts for yourself and others.
Ask teammates or online communities for help.

d) Working with a Team. The Problem: Miscommunication can lead to unnecessary mistakes.
How to Fix It:
Keep your messages short, simple and clear.
Use tools like Git to track work.
Ask questions if you’re unsure about something.

e) Handling Deadlines & Stress. The Problem: Too much work without enough time to go through your work and check your own work.
How to Fix It:
Break tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.
Take breaks when needed.
Ask for help or extensions if necessary.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing – Testing individual components, checking if a login function works.
2. Integration Testing – Ensuring different modules work together,making sure a shopping cart connects with payment processing.
3. System Testing – Testing the entire system to verify it meets requirements,checking if an e-commerce site functions properly.
4. Acceptance Testing – Validating if the software meets the end user's needs before final release, letting users test a new feature in beta mode.

Their importance 
Prevents bugs before they reach users.
Saves money by fixing issues early.
Ensures software runs smoothly and securely.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the instructions (prompts) given to an AI model to get the best possible response. It’s like asking a question in the right way to get a clear and useful answer.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective

The importance of Prompt Engineering 
1. Improves AI Responses – A well-crafted prompt helps AI give more accurate and relevant answers.
2. Saves Time – Clear prompts reduce the need for follow-up questions.
3. Enhances Creativity – AI can generate more detailed, unique, or structured responses with better prompts.
4. Solves Complex Problems – AI can be guided to analyze data, generate ideas, or automate tasks effectively.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about science."

Improved Prompt: "Can you explain how climate change affects ocean life, with specific examples?"

Improved Prompt is better because:
1. More Focused – Instead of a broad topic like "science," it asks about climate change and ocean life.
2. Clear Expectations – The AI knows to include examples, making the answer more useful.
3. Less Guesswork – A vague question can lead to an answer that may not be what you’re looking for. A specific prompt ensures a more relevant response.
